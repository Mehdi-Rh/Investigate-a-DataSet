There are 110725 appointment on the dataset with 13 features
(PatientId	AppointmentID, Gender	ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism	Handcap, SMS_received, No-show)


## Conclusion 

Referring to this dataset, each factor influence slightly on the showing up wich doesn't give any effective conclusion

## Limitation

The dataset: is limited in terms of quantity of data, with more data of several years the investigation can be more efficient.

Time: with the limit of time I couldn't do advanced statistical analysis.
